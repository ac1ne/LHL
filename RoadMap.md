### Loading
  - add a lazy loading method and save buffers instead of loading and saving the entire log every change to log
### Resolution
  - remove fixed geometry and go to a scalable dynamic system
### Variables / Config
  - define variables in a easily located spot to allow for quick editing of configuration
### Reorganize
  - I would like to reorganize my code into smaller modular sections instead of 1 long script.
### Software Compatablilty 
  - would like to add a socket connection for major amateur radio digital sofware to auto log contacts.
### Compatablility
  - Android and ipad support (this may take some time)
    - for this I will have to build a mobile specific version using Kivy instead of QtPy

If there are any features you would like me to add contact me
