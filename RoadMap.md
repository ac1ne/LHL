### Reorganize
  - I would like to reorganize my code into smaller sections instead of 1 long script.
### QRZ
  - Potential for link out from entered call sign to QRZ.
### Software Compatablilty 
  - would like to add a socket connection for major amateur radio digital sofware to auto log contacts.
### Compatablility
  - Android and ipad support (this may take some time)
    - for this I will have to build a mobile specific version using Kivy instead of QtPy

If there are any features you would like me to add contact me
