### Editing
- Improved input time and date fields:
  - Users can now only enter valid times (00:00 to 23:59) and valid dates (including correct month and day ranges).
  
- Enhanced editing:
  - Single-digit hours, minutes, months, or days are now accepted and automatically formatted with leading zeros (e.g., "8:55" becomes "08:55" or "2025-8-5" beccomes "2025-08-05").
  - Table display remains consistent and always shows times and dates in the correct format.

### Editing
  - Fixed an issue were the table was saved in visual order instead of numeric order that caused data to get overwritten
