Resolution / Scaling can sometimes cause issues due to geometry. Potential fix adjust the resolution on your monitor to accomodate. 

When editing field if the curser is in the right most position of the field the user can't type fix arrow key over left

If time or date is outside of range it defaults to last hour/minute or month/day so if a user puts in 26:99 or 2025-13-44 it becomes 23:59 and 2025-12-31 i am working on either an error or highlighting method to warn the user that this is invalid

I am not a coder and don't know how to correct this if you have a helpful solution, If you notice any other issues. or have sugestions please feel free to contact me.
