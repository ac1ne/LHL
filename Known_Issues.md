### Sorting
    When in edit mode if a column is sorted and an edit is made then that column is resorted the edited cell retains the prevoius sort value
      Potential fix sort to a different column and then sort the desired column. This does not affect sorting on the main log only edit mode.
      
### Monitor Size
    Resolution / Scaling can sometimes cause issues due to geometry. Potential fix adjust the resolution on your monitor to accomodate. 

### Curser
    When editing field if the curser is in the right most position of the field the user can't type fix arrow key over left
